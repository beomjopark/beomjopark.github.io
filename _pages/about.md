I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics & Data Science](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu), Pittsburgh, PA. Current research interests largely lie in the robust statistical inference including how to better accommodate the model misspecification. I have been collaborating with oceanographers on developing flexible statistical models for large-scale oceanographic data. 

Prior to joining the Carnegie Mellon University, I have worked on wide-ranging applications and extensions in the Bayesian semiparametric regression and Variational inference while pursuing an M.Sc. in Statistics at [Korea University](http://korea.edu) advised by Dr. Taeryon Choi. Hierarchical modeling and fast Variational Bayes approximation to the flexible Bayesian regression framework were the central themes. I earned B.Sc. in Industrial engineering and Statistics at Korea University.
