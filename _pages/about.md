I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics & Data Science](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA. Current research interests largely lie in the robust statistical inference including how to better accommodate the model misspecification. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Sivaraman Balakrishnan](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~siva/) and [Larry Wasserman](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/). I have also been collaborating with oceanographers and [Mikael Kuusela](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~mkuusela/) on developing statistical framework for large-scale oceanographic data. I am a member of the [Statistical Machine Learning Reading](http://statml.cs.cmu.edu/) group and the [Statistical Methods for the Physical Sciences](http://stat.cmu.edu/stamps/) group.

Prior to joining the Carnegie Mellon University, I have worked on wide-ranging applications and extensions in the Bayesian semiparametric regression and Variational inference while pursuing an M.Sc. in Statistics at [Korea University](http://korea.edu) advised by [Taeryon Choi](https://sites.google.com/site/trchoi/home). Hierarchical modeling and fast Variational Bayes approximation to the flexible Bayesian regression framework were the central themes. I earned B.Sc. in Industrial engineering and Statistics at Korea University.
