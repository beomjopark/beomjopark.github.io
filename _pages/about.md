I am a Data Scientist, Research at Google, developing quantitative methods to optimize creative generation and drive systematic efficiencies in YouTube Ads. I earned Ph.D. in Statistics from [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/), where my research focused on robust statistical inference, including assumption-light methods for accommodating model misspecification. I was very fortunate to be advised by [Sivaraman Balakrishnan](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~siva/) and [Larry Wasserman](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/). In collaboration with oceanographers and [Mikael Kuusela](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~mkuusela/), I also developed a spatiotemporal framework for large-scale oceanographic data from Argo floats to provide data-driven insights into global ocean heat transport and related dynamical phenomena, such as El Niño & La Niña.

<!-- I am a member of the [Statistical Machine Learning Reading](http://statml.cs.cmu.edu/) group and the [Statistical Methods for the Physical Sciences](http://stat.cmu.edu/stamps/) group. -->

Prior to joining the Carnegie Mellon University, I worked on wide-ranging applications and extensions in the Bayesian semiparametric regression and Variational inference at [Korea University](http://korea.edu) advised by [Taeryon Choi](https://sites.google.com/site/trchoi/home). Hierarchical modeling and fast Variational Bayes approximation to the flexible Bayesian regression framework were the central themes.
